# `Field`

`Field` is a thin wrapper around `useField`. This can be useful if you don't want to create whole components just to call `useField`,
but you still want to optimize the rendering behavior of individual fields.

The props of `Field` are the same as `useField`, but it takes a function as its children.
Any state accessed through this render prop will only cause that particular field to re-render.

```tsx
<Field scope={form.scope("myField")}>
  {(field) => <input {...field.getInputProps()} />}
</Field>
```
