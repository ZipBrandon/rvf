# `FieldArrayApi`

The `FieldArrayApi` provides helpers for interacting with field arrays.

## `FieldApi` methods

### `map`

<Row>
  <Col>
    Maps over the items in the array and return the results.
    Your map function will receive the following arguments:

    - `key`: A unique string key you can use as the `key` prop when rendering the list of items.
      When you have your own key available (like the `id` of an item), it's recommended to use that instead.
    - `item`: A [`FormApi`](/reference/form-api) scoped to that item in the array.
    - `index`: The index of the item in the array.

    This is most commonly used to render the items in the array,
    but you can return anything you want from the map function.

  </Col>

  <Col>

    ```tsx
    myArray.map((key, item, index) => (
      <div key={key}>
        {item.value("name")}
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={() => {
            myArray.remove(index);
          }}
        >
          Delete
        </button>
      </div>
    ));
    ```

  </Col>
</Row>

### `error`

Returns the array-level error message, if there is one.
This is commonly something along the lines of "Must have at least one item".

### `length`

Returns the length of the array.

```typescript
const length = myArray.length();
```

### `name`

Returns the name of the field.

```typescript
const name = myArray.name();
```

### `push`

Adds an item to the end of the array.

```typescript
myArray.push({ name: "New item" });
```

### `pop`

Removes the last item in the array.

```typescript
myArray.pop();
```

### `shift`

Removes the first item in the array.

```typescript
myArray.shift();
```

### `unshift`

Adds an item to the start of the array.

```typescript
myArray.unshift({ name: "New item" });
```

### `insert`

Inserts an item at a specific index in the array.

```typescript
myArray.insert(1, { name: "New item" });
```

### `move`

Moves an item from `fromIndex` to `toIndex` in the array.
This process happens by removing the item at `fromIndex` and inserting it at `toIndex`.
Keep this in mind if your `toIndex` is after the `fromIndex`.

```typescript
myArray.move(0, 1);
```

### `swap`

Swaps the items at `fromIndex` and `toIndex`.

```typescript
myArray.swap(0, 1);
```

### `remove`

Removes an item at the given index from the array.

```typescript
myArray.remove(1);
```

### `replace`

Replaces an item in the array.

```typescript
myArray.replace(1, { name: "New item" });
```

### `errorFocusElement`

Normally, when a user submits a form and it contains validation error,
the first invalid element in the form will be focused.
Pass this ref to a focusable element to simulate this behavior when there are array-level errors
for this field array.

### `keys`

Returns an array of the keys used when mapping over the array.
The identity of the array is stable and only updates (and causes a rerender)
when the number of items in the array changes, or the array is reset.
This is usually not necesary, but can be useful for some advanced scenarios.
