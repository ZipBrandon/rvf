# `FieldArray`

`FieldArray` is a thin wrapper around `useFieldArray`. This can be useful if you don't want to create whole components just to call `useFieldArray`,
but you still want to optimize the rendering behavior of the field array.

The props of `FieldArray` are the same as `useFieldArray`, but it takes a function as its children.
Any state accessed through this render prop will only cause that particular field array to re-render.

```tsx
<FieldArray scope={form.scope("myFieldArray")}>
  {(array) =>
    array.map((key, item, index) => <MyInput key={key} scope={item.scope()} />)
  }
</FieldArray>
```
