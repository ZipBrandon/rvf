# `FieldApi`

The `FieldApi` provides helpers for interacting with a specific field.

## `FieldApi` methods

### `getInputProps`

Returns props that can be spread onto native form controls or thin wrappers around them.
It's generally recommended to use this with native form controls.
And pass any other props through this helper.

It's important that the component you spread the props into accepts the `ref` prop.
This allows RVF to set the value of the field when setValue is called, and is used
to focus the field when it has an error.

```tsx
<input {...field.getInputProps({ type: "number" })} />
```

### `getControlProps`

Returns props that can be spread into [controlled components](/controlled-fields) to use as a field.
It's important to pass the provided `ref` to a focusable HTML element.
This allows the field to be focused when it has an error and also disables RVF's default
behavior of automatically listening to changes in the field.

### `getHiddenInputProps`

Returns props that can be spread into a native form control to use as a hidden field.
This is useful in combination with `getControlProps`.

### `name`

Returns the name of the field.

### `value`

Returns the curent value of the field.

### `setValue`

Sets the value of the field.

### `defaultValue`

Returns the default value of the field.

### `touched`

Returns whether or not the field has been touched.

### `setTouched`

Manually sets the touched state of the field.

### `dirty`

Returns whether or not the field has been changed.

### `setDirty`

Manually sets the dirty state of the field.

### `error`

Returns the error message for the field, if there is one.

### `clearError`

Clears the error message for the field.

### `validate`

Manually triggers validation for the field.

### `reset`

Resets the field to its initial value.
This also resets any touched, dirty, or validation errors for the field.
This works for both controlled and uncontrolled fields.
For uncontrolled fields, this will manually set the value of the form control using the `ref` returned by `field`.

### `onChange`

Has the same behavior as `getControlProps().onChange`.
Can be useful when simply spreading `getControlProps` isn't enough for your use-case.

### `onBlur`

Has the same behavior as `getControlProps().onBlur`.
Can be useful when simply spreading `getControlProps` isn't enough for your use-case.

### `refs`

You usually don't need to use this. It's intended for advanced use-cases.
Allows you to directly set the `ref` of the field.
There are two functions available: `refs.controlled` and `refs.transient`.
The ref you choose to use will change the way RVF interacts with the field.

If you use `refs.transient`, then RVF will treat the field as an uncontrolled field.
If you use `refs.controlled`, then RVF will treat the field as a controlled field.
