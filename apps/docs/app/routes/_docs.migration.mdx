# Migrating to v6

RVF v6 is a ground-up rewrite of remix-validated-form, where some of the core design desicisions have been reconsidered
and updated.

## Overview

### Decoupled from Remix

RVF no longer requires Remix. It can be with any flavor of React, but there's also an adapter specifically for Remix.

### Simplified, more predictable API

Many of the idiosyncrasies of remix-validated-form have been improved upon.
Several APIs have been removed, because they aren't necessary anymore.

### More powerful

Even though the RVF api is simpler and more predictable, it's also a lot more powerful.
There's also an additional escape hatch for advanced use-cases called [state mode](/state-mode).

### Better render optimizations

The RVF api now makes use of proxy-based access tracking to ensure that renders are only triggered when necessary.

## Migrating

### New package names

`remix-validated-form` has been renamed to only `RVF`, and has new package names.

- @rvf/react
- @rvf/react-router
- @rvf/zod
- @rvf/yup

This has the benefit of making it possible to adopt RVF gradually, instead of migrating your entire app at once.
You can install the RVF packages alongside your existing remix-validated-form packages and start using it for new code right away.

### Hook-first API

The recommended, default API for RVF is now the [`useForm`](/reference/use-form) hook, rather than [`ValidatedForm`](/reference/validated-form).
_However_, `ValidatedForm` is still supported and isn't going anywhere -- it even supports a render-prop now.

### Removed "use outside of form" APIs

You can no longer pass a form id to RVF hooks in order to access the form context outside of a `ValidatedForm` component.
RVF _still_ supports putting inputs outside of your `form` element, but it's supported naturally by the `useForm` hook
rather than requiring extra API support. If you're using `getInputProps`, RVF will automatically add the `form` prop for you,
so you don't need to do anything special.

In `remix-validated-form`, a common pattern was to use this feature in the parent of the form like this:

```tsx
export const MyForm = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useControlledField(
    "name",
    "myFormId",
  );

  return (
    <ValidatedForm
      validator={myValidator}
      method="post"
      id="myFormId"
    >
      <MyInput
        name="name"
        value={value}
        onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
      />
    </ValidatedForm>
  );
};
```

This is no longer supported or necessary. To migrate this situation, you could either switch to the `useForm` hook,
or use the render prop API of `ValidatedForm`.

<CodeExamples title="Migrating" tabs={["useForm hook", "ValidatedForm render prop"]}>

```tsx
const MyForm = () => {
  const form = useForm({
    validator: myValidator,
    method: "post",
  });

  return (
    <FormProvider scope={form.scope()}>
      <form {...form.getFormProps()}>
        <MyInput
          name="name"
          value={form.value("name")}
          onChange={(e) =>
            form.setValue("name", e.target.value)
          }
        />
      </form>
    </FormProvider>
  );
};
```

```tsx
const MyForm = () => {
  return (
    <ValidatedForm validator={myValidator} method="post">
      {(form) => (
        <MyInput
          name="name"
          value={form.value("name")}
          onChange={(e) =>
            form.setValue("name", e.target.value)
          }
        />
      )}
    </ValidatedForm>
  );
};
```

</CodeExamples>

### Deprecated hooks

These hooks are deprecated because they're no longer necessary with the new api.
Each hook below includes a recipe for how you could re-implement it in userland using the new APIs.

Many of these relied on being used within the context of a `ValidatedForm` component.
If you're using `ValidatedForm`, that will still work. But if you're using `useForm` directly,
you'll need to use a `FormProvider` in order to provide the context for these hooks.
These recipes also support being directly passed a `FormScope` instead of being rendered inside a `FormProvider`.

  <summary>useIsSubmitting</summary>

```typescript
export const useIsSubmitting = (rvf?: FormScope<any>) =>
  useFormScopeOrContext(rvf).formState.isSubmitting;
```

<details>
  <summary>useIsValid</summary>

```typescript
export const useIsValid = (rvf?: FormScope<any>) =>
  useFormScopeOrContext(rvf).formState.isValid;
```

<details>
  <summary>useControlField</summary>

```typescript
export const useControlField = <T>(
  name: string,
  rvf?: FormScope<any>,
) => {
  const form = useFormScopeOrContext(rvf);
  const value: T = form.value(name);
  const setValue = useCallback(
    (value: T) => form.setValue(name, value),
    [form, name],
  );
  return [value, setValue] as const;
};
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>useUpdateControlledField</summary>

```typescript
export const useUpdateControlledField = (
  rvf?: FormScope<any>,
) => {
  const form = useFormScopeOrContext(rvf);
  return useCallback(
    (name: string, value: any) =>
      form.setValue(name, value),
    [form],
  );
};
```

</details>

`setFormDefaults` is also deprecated, but there's no userland replacement. It will continue to work for now,
and will be removed in a future major version.

### Reworked `useFormContext`

`useFormContext` now returns a [`FormApi`](/reference/form-api).

### Other breaking changes

- Unmounting controlled fields no longer clears the value stored for that field.
  This should result in more predictable behavior and give you more control over your form state.

- `form.validate` now simply returns an object of validation errors, rather than an object with an `error` and `data` field.

- The `handleReceiveFocus` API no longer exists. To set the focus target for a controlled field,
  pass the a `ref` from `getControlProps` or `useField().refs.controlled` to a focusable html element.

- There is no longer a dedicated `subaction` prop. You can add this to your forms manually with a hidden input,
  or you can use the `rvfFormId` field instead. The `rvfFormId` field is set automtically when JS is enabled or when using `ValidatedForm`,
  but you must render it with `form.renderFormIdInput` when using `useForm`.

- `Validator.validateField` was deprecated and has now been removed.

- `defaultValues` can no longer be configured using a flat object of string paths (e.g. `defaultValues: { "foo.bar": "baz" }`).
  This feature was unintended and undocumented, but there were a few users who were using it.

- Field paths can no longer use dot notation for array indeces (e.g. `foo.0.bar`).
  This was unintended and undocumented, but there were a few users who were using it.
