# Quick start

You only need a couple things to get started with RVF.

## Validators

<Row>
  <Col>
    All validation in RVF is done at the form level using a `validator`.
    RVF has first-party validation adaptors for `zod` and `yup`, but you can also create your own.
  </Col>
  <Col>
    <CodeExamples title="Creating a validator" tabs={["Zod", "Yup"]}>
      ```typescript
      import { withZod } from "@rvf/zod";
      import { z } from "zod";

      const validator = withZod(
        z.object({
          name: z.string().min(1),
          email: z.string().email().min(1),
        }),
      )
      ```

      ```typescript
      import { withYup } from "@rvf/yup";
      import * as yup from "yup";

      const validator = withYup(
        yup.object({
          name: z.string().required(),
          email: z.string().email().required(),
        }),
      )
      ```
    </CodeExamples>

  </Col>
</Row>

## Connecting it to your form

<Row>
  <Col>
    By default, RVF let's the browser do most of the heavy lifting,
    so it must be used with a native html `form` element (though there is an [escape hatch](/state-mode)).
  </Col>
  <Col>
    ```tsx
      import { useForm } from "@rvf/react";

      const validator = // The validator we created above

      const MyForm = () => {
        const form = useForm({
          validator,
        });

        return (
          <form {...form.getFormProps()}>
            <label>
              Name
              <input name="name" />
            </label>

            <label>
              Email
              <input name="email" />
            </label>

            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
          </form>
        );
      }
    ```

  </Col>
</Row>

## Choose how to show your errors

<Row>
  <Col>
    Now you can access your form's validation errors using `form.error("fieldName")`.
    It's common to simply display these errors in the UI, but RVF also provides a
    `useNativeValidity` hook you can use to display errors using [`setCustomValidity`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/setCustomValidity).
  </Col>
  <Col>
    ```diff
      <label>
        Name
    -   <input name="name" />
    +   <input name="name" aria-describedby="name-error" />
      </label>
    + {form.error("name") && (
    +   <div id="name-error">{form.error("name")}</div>
    + )}
    ```
  </Col>
</Row>

## Getting a little more power

With this setup you can use many of the features of RVF.
Pretty much all of the RVF features that _observe_ the form will work now.

- Validation
- Listening to changes in input values
- Observing dirty & touched states
- etc.

Plus a couple other things like:

- Programmatically moving focus to any field in the form
- Modifying dirty & touched states

But what we _can't_ do yet is to modify the form's values,
either with default values or programmatically modifying the form on the fly.

### Wiring up the inputs

<Row>
  <Col>
    To be able to make changes to the form's values, we need to wire up the inputs
    with `form.getInputProps`.
  </Col>
  <Col>
    ```diff
    -   <input name="name" aria-describedby="name-error" />
    +   <input
    +     {...form.getInputProps("name")}
    +     aria-describedby="name-error"
    +   />
    ```
  </Col>
</Row>

## Next steps

That's all you really need to get started, but it isn't all RVF can do.
Check out the guides or the API reference to learn more about power features like

- Nested objects and arrays
- Field arrays
- Controlled components
- Creating your own powerful, typesafe abstractions using form scopes.
- "State mode"
