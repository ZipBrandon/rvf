# `useFormScopeOrContext`

Accesses the [`FormApi`](/reference/form-api) either through explicitly passing a FormScope, or through context.
This is most useful in cases where you have re-usable components and some of your forms use context, while others don't.
This is used internally by hooks like [`useField`](/reference/use-field) to allow you to pass a field name instead of a scope.

When passing a scope, this behaves exactly like [`useFormScope`](/reference/use-form-scope).
When no scope is passed, this behaves exactly like [`useFormContext`](/reference/use-form-context).

<Note>
  If you're using Typescript, you lose a lot of type safety
  when using the context API
</Note>

## Usage

```tsx
const MyForm = ({ scope }: { scope?: FormScope<any> }) => {
  const form = useFormScopeOrContext(scope);

  // ...etc
};
```
