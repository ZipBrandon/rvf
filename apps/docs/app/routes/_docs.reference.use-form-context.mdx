# `useFormContext`

Accesses the [`FormApi`](/reference/form-api) via context. Must be used along with a [`FormProvider`](/reference/form-provider) or [`ValidatedForm`](/reference/validated-form).
This is just like calling [`useFormScope`](/reference/use-form-scope), but using context instead of passing the scope around.

<Note>
  If you're using Typescript, you lose a lot of type safety
  when using the context API
</Note>

## Usage

```tsx
const MyForm = () => {
  const form = useFormContext();

  // ...etc
};
```
