# `useFieldArray`

`useFieldArray` can be used to tap into an RVF form in a nested field-array component.

## Arguments

<Row>
  <Col>
    The recommended way to use `useFieldArray` is to pass a `FormScope` to it that's been scoped down to the array you want to interact with.
    This method is especially recommended Typescript users, because it provides solid type-safety.

    However, you can also pass a string to `useFieldArray` and it will tap React context to find the `FormScope` for you.

  </Col>
  <Col>

    ```tsx
      const field = useFieldArray(form.scope("myFieldArray"));

      // or

      const field = useFieldArray("myFieldArray");
    ```

  </Col>
</Row>

### Additional options

<Row>
  <Col>
    `useFieldArray` also accepts an optional second argument with additional options.
    Currently, there's only one option here, and that's `validationBehavior`.
    This option allows you to customize _when_ RVF validates the field array in response to array operations.
    
    This has one less option than the validation behavior for individual fields,
    because arrays of fields can't really be "touched".
    
    - `initial`
      - How the field array should be validated initially
      - default: `"onSubmit"`
    - `whenSubmitted`
      - How the field array should be validated once the form has been submitted
      - default: `"onChange"`
    
  </Col>
  <Col>
  
    ```tsx
      const field = useFieldArray(form.scope("myFieldArray"), {
        validationBehavior: {
          initial: "onChange",
          whenSubmitted: "onChange",
        },
      });
    ```
  
  </Col>
</Row>

## Return type

`useFieldArray` returns a [`FieldArrayApi`](/reference/field-array-api) object.
