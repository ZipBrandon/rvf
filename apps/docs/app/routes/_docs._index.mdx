# RVF

Easy form validation and state management for React.

### Progressively enhanced

RVF leans into native form APIs, so it's easy to add to your existing forms.
It even works without JavaScript on the client if you're using a server-rendered framework like [Remix / React Router](https://remix.run).

### Powerful

When you need to scale up and write bigger, more complicated forms, RVF can scale with you.

- Easily manages nested objects and arrays in at typesafe way -- even when they're recursive.
- Set default values for the whole form in one place.
- Re-use your validation on the server.
