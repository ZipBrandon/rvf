# `useField`

`useField` can be used to tap into an RVF form in a nested field component.

## Arguments

<Row>
  <Col>
    The recommended way to use `useField` is to pass a `FormScope` to it that's been scoped down to the field you want to interact with.
    This method is especially recommended Typescript users, because it provides solid type-safety.

    However, you can also pass a string to `useField` and it will tap React context to find the `FormScope` for you.

  </Col>
  <Col>

    ```tsx
      const field = useField(form.scope("myField"));

      // or

      const field = useField("myField");
    ```

  </Col>
</Row>

### Additional options

<Row>
  <Col>
    `useField` also accepts an optional second argument with additional options.
    Currently, there's only one option here, and that's `validationBehavior`.
    This option allows you to customize _when_ RVF validates the field.
    
    - `initial`
      - How the field should be validated initially
      - default: `"onBlur"`
    - `whenTouched`
      - How the field should be validated once it has been touched
      - default: `"onChange"`
    - `whenSubmitted`
      - How the field should be validated once the form has been submitted
      - default: `"onChange"`
    
  </Col>
  <Col>
  
    ```tsx
      const field = useField(form.scope("myField"), {
        validationBehavior: {
          initial: "onBlur",
          whenTouched: "onChange",
          whenSubmitted: "onChange",
        },
      });
    ```
  
  </Col>
</Row>

## Return type

`useField` returns a [`FieldApi`](/reference/field-api) object.
